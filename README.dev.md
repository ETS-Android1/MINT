## Branch system

There are different types of branch you need to create : 

1) for new features : features/nameOfTheFeature

2) for fixing bug : bugFix/nameOfTheBug

3) for refactoring : refactoring/name

For your commits, enter your messages in english.

After created and implemented (AND TESTED), you can push it on GitHub,
via git push --set-upstream origin nameOfBranch



Then, go to Github and create a pull Request with develop,
assign it to Mathis Barthere for review and click on create Pull Request.
